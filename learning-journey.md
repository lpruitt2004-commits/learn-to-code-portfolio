# React & JavaScript Developer Journey

## CLxL2: Dual AI Model Workflow

**CLxL2** is a workflow that combines the strengths of two open-source AI models:

- **CodeLlama-13B**: Specialized for code generation, review, and programming help.
- **Llama 2-13B**: General-purpose language model for conversation, research, and non-code tasks.

**How it works:**
- Route code-related questions, code review, and programming tasks to CodeLlama-13B.
- Route general language, research, or conversational queries to Llama 2-13B.
- Use both models together for a more versatile and effective AI assistant experience.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Ask CodeLlama-13B to generate or review code snippets, debug, or explain programming concepts.
- Ask Llama 2-13B for writing help, research, summaries, or brainstorming.

> This workflow allows you to maximize productivity by leveraging the best capabilities of each model. Document your results and share your experience in your portfolio!

## How to Use AI for Robust Learning

- **GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1):** Use for code autocompletion, real-time suggestions, and code explanations in all folders.
- **OpenAI GPT-4.1:** Ask for in-depth explanations, debugging help, and best practices as you work through exercises.
- **Copilot Chat / ChatGPT:** Use for brainstorming, pair programming, and technical writing.
- **Perplexity AI / Google Gemini:** Research new concepts, find documentation, and stay updated.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** Experiment with AI/ML models in your own projects (see `beyondAiContinuousLearning`).
- **Tabnine / Codeium:** Supplement code completion and bug-fixing suggestions.

> **Tip:** Add comments in your code like `// copilot: explain this` or `// copilot: suggest improvement` to get targeted AI help.

# Fullstack & Tooling Assignments

Welcome! This section will help you build and deploy fullstack web applications using Node.js, Express, React, and modern developer tools.

## Topics Covered
- **Node.js/Express REST API:** Build backend servers and APIs.
- **Connecting React to APIs:** Fetch and display data in your frontend.
- **Authentication (JWT, OAuth):** Secure your apps and manage users.
- **Deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Docker):** Put your projects online.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):** Automate testing and deployment.

## Example Assignments
- Build a simple REST API with Express.
- Connect your React app to the API and display data.
- Add authentication to protect routes and data.
- Deploy your app to Vercel, Netlify, or with Docker.
- Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Scaffold a Node.js/Express project: `npm init -y && npm install express`.
2. Create API endpoints and test them with Postman or curl.
3. Scaffold a React app and connect it to your API using fetch or axios.
4. Add authentication (JWT or OAuth) to your backend and frontend.
5. Deploy your app and set up CI/CD for automated builds and tests.
6. Use comments like `// ai: explain JWT` or `// ai: suggest improvement` to get help from your AI assistant.
7. Commit your progress regularly and document your work.

## AI Prompt Suggestions
- "How do I create a REST API with Express?"
- "Show an example of JWT authentication."
- "How do I deploy a Node.js app with Docker?"
- "How do I set up GitHub Actions for my project?"

> Remember: Break down each task, experiment, and ask your AI assistant for help whenever you're stuck!

// Practice exercises for authentication (JWT, OAuth)
// Welcome! This file will help you practice adding authentication to your apps.

// Example: JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication
// ai: What is JWT and how does it work?
// In a real app, you would send a login request to the server, which returns a JWT.
// You store the token (usually in localStorage) and send it with API requests.

// TODO: Simulate a login by storing a fake token in localStorage and checking it before showing protected content.

// Example: OAuth basics
// ai: What is OAuth and when should I use it?
// OAuth lets users log in with services like Google or GitHub.
// In a real app, you'd redirect to the provider, then handle the callback with a token.

// TODO: Research how to add Google login to a React app (hint: use a library like react-oauth/google).

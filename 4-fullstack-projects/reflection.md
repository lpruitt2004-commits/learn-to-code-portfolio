# Reflection Journal: Fullstack Projects

After each project, jot down what you learned, what challenged you, and what you want to explore next.

## Example Prompts
- What was the most interesting thing you built?
- Where did you get stuck, and how did you solve it?
- What do you want to practice more?
- How will you apply this knowledge in future work?

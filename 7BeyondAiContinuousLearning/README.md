# Beyond: AI & Continuous Learning

Welcome to the next level! This section helps you go beyond the basics—integrate AI, explore new frameworks, contribute to open source, and keep your skills sharp.

## Topics
- **Integrate OpenAI API or Hugging Face models into React:** Add AI features to your apps.
- **Explore Next.js or Remix:** Learn server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
- **Contribute to open source:** Give back and learn from real-world codebases.
- **Stay updated:** Follow newsletters, podcasts, and join the dev community.

## Example Assignments
- Build a React app that uses the OpenAI API for text or image generation.
- Create a Next.js or Remix app with SSR/SSG.
- Make your first open source pull request (PR) on GitHub.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. For each topic, create a subfolder and starter files as needed.
2. Read the topic description and break it into smaller learning goals.
3. Use comments like `// ai: explain this API call` or `// ai: suggest a learning resource` to get help from your AI assistant.
4. Document your learning journey in each README.
5. When contributing to open source, start with beginner-friendly issues and read the project's CONTRIBUTING.md.
6. Stay curious—subscribe to newsletters, listen to podcasts, and join online communities.

## AI Prompt Suggestions
- "How do I use the OpenAI API in React?"
- "Show an example of SSR with Next.js."
- "How do I find beginner-friendly open source issues?"
- "What are the best JavaScript newsletters?"

> Tip: Continuous learning is key to staying relevant. Use your AI assistant to explore new topics and deepen your understanding!

# Projects

Welcome to your project portfolio! Here you'll build real-world apps to showcase your skills. Each project is designed to reinforce your learning and help you create a strong portfolio.

## Portfolio Projects
- **Portfolio site (React):** Show off your work and skills.
- **CRUD app (e.g., task manager):** Practice Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.
- **E-commerce/storefront:** Simulate a real online store.
- **Blog with authentication:** Learn user auth and protected content.
- **API integration project:** Connect to and display data from external APIs.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. For each project, create a new folder and starter files (`README.md`, `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js` or React files).
2. Read the project description and break it into smaller tasks.
3. Use comments like `// ai: explain this function` or `// ai: suggest a better UI` to get help from your AI assistant.
4. Commit your progress often and write clear commit messages.
5. When stuck, ask your AI assistant for code examples, explanations, or debugging help.
6. After finishing, write a summary in the project README about what you learned.

## AI Prompt Suggestions
- "How do I fetch data from an API in React?"
- "Show an example of a CRUD operation in JavaScript."
- "How do I implement authentication in a blog app?"
- "Suggest improvements for my e-commerce UI."

> Tip: Treat each project as a portfolio piece. Focus on clean code, good documentation, and learning from mistakes!

# Web Dev Prep Course

This section covers the basics of how the web works and the tools you'll use as a developer.

## How the Web Works
- The web is a network of computers communicating via the Internet
- Browsers send requests to servers, which respond with web pages
- Web pages are built with HTML, styled with CSS, and made interactive with JavaScript

### Browser-Server Flow
1. User enters a URL in the browser
2. Browser sends an HTTP request to the server
3. Server processes the request and sends back HTML/CSS/JS files
4. Browser renders the page

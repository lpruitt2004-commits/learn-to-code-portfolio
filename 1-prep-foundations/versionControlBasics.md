# Version Control Basics

Version control lets you track changes to your code and collaborate with others. Git is the most popular tool.

## What is Version Control?
- Tracks changes to files over time
- Allows you to revert to previous versions
- Enables collaboration

## Git Basics
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git status
git log
```

## GitHub Workflows
- Create a repo on GitHub
- Push your code:
```bash
git remote add origin <repo-url>
git push -u origin master
```

## Collaboration Tips
- Use branches for new features
- Write clear commit messages
- Pull before you push

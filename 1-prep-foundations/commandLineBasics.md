# Command Line Basics

The command line (terminal) lets you control your computer with text commands.

## Basic Commands
- `pwd` — print working directory
- `ls` — list files
- `cd` — change directory
- `mkdir` — make directory
- `touch` — create a file

## File Navigation
```bash
cd /home/yourname/projects
ls -lh
```

## Scripting
```bash
echo "Hello, world!" > hello.txt
cat hello.txt
```

## Productivity Tips
- Use tab for autocompletion
- Use up/down arrows to repeat commands
- Use `man` for help (e.g., `man ls`)

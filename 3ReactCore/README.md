# React Core Assignments

Welcome! This section will help you get started with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Getting Started
1. Scaffold a new React app in this folder using one of these commands:
	- `npx create-react-app my-react-app`
	- `npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react`
2. Open the `src` folder in your new app to begin coding.
3. Practice with JSX, components, props, state, and hooks.

## Example Assignments
- **Counter App:** Build a simple counter with increment/decrement buttons.
- **Dynamic List:** Create a list where users can add and remove items.
- **Form with Validation:** Make a form that checks for valid input before submitting.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Start your React app: `npm start` or `yarn dev` (for Vite).
2. Open `src/App.js` (or `App.jsx`) and begin with the first assignment.
3. Use comments like `// ai: explain useState` or `// ai: suggest improvement` to get help from your AI assistant.
4. Test your app in the browser as you build.
5. Commit your progress regularly.

## AI Prompt Suggestions
- "How do I use useState in React?"
- "Show an example of a controlled input."
- "How do I pass props between components?"
- "How do I handle form validation in React?"

> Remember: Experiment, break things, and ask your AI assistant for help whenever you're stuck!
